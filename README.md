This app is being built for Scrum Poker Planning/Story Point Estimating.

Client App is in progress and I am using React as the client app technology. As of the commit, I have built:
- Form generator
- Game board
- Story Cards
- Grid
- Setup Components
  - Project
  - Sprint

To do 
- Actual forms
- History/Report

- Package Paths With Index.js

The client application as a whole is not working yet.
